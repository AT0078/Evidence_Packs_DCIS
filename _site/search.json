In this context, 'Supports Good' merely means these waterbodies are not considered to have pristine morphology.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Waterbodies with Physical Modification as their Significant Waterbody Management Issue\nThe below map shows waterbodies in the Avon Bristol Urban which have morphology as their SWMI. More granular, reach-level data on morphology can be viewed by clicking the River Habitat Survey (RHS) box in the top right.\nThe median RHS Habitat Quality Assessment Score in Wessex is 42, in the Avon Bristol Urban, the median RHS HQA is 36. Low scores often indicate channelisation, whilst high scores indicate a more natural physical habitat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Reasons for Not Acheiving Good\nThe below table shows RNAGs which either have morphology as their primary reason for failure (very rare) or either of their main pressures as morphology (more common).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Measures\nMeasures for the waterbodies identified above are shown in the table below."

The comparison of the observed to expected values is known as an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR).

Enabling informed catchment management decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMany of the figures within this report are interactive; if you’re curious, click or zoom in on figures to discover more.\n\n\n\n\n\nAvon at Conham River Park"
