title: "`r unique(CAT$OPCAT_NAME)` Catchment Evidence Pack"
---

## Foreword

This Catchment Evidence Pack is for the `r unique(CAT$OPCAT_NAME)` operational catchment, it includes information on catchment pressures and provides access to data at a catchment, waterbody and monitoring site scale. It draws together a range of information and evidence to help us better understand the environmental condition and pressures acting within the catchment.

This comprehensive tool integrates water quality, ecology, physical habitat and water resources data from internal Environment Agency databases such as: Water Information Management System (WIMS), Catchment Planning System (CPS), Ecosys, Biosys and where applicable, third-party data.

Its primary aim is to provide practitioners with easy access to a wealth of additional catchment information on pressures as well as ensuring a clear understanding of the spatial and temporal coverage of monitoring across waterbodies, sites, and classification years. Enabling informed catchment management decisions.
