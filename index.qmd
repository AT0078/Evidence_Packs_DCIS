## Foreword

The existing spatiotemporal coverage of monitoring, pivotal for informing Water Framework Directive (WFD) statuses of waterbodies, is now notably constrained. Unfortunately, this limitation is not transparently reflected in WFD statuses, leading our practitioners to make decisions based on either imprecise data or, in some cases, no data at all.

The primary objective of this app is to consolidate a diverse range of data sources underpinning WFD statuses. This comprehensive tool integrates data from WIMS, Ecosys, River Habitat Survey, and, where available, third-party contributions from Citizen Science and Water Company monitoring. The overarching goal is to offer practitioners easy access to a wealth of information, at different scales which is required for catchment management.

We want to enable practicioners to review our evidence with ease, identify *reasons* waterbodies *are not achieving good* status (RNAGs) and then and put in place measures to restore waterbodies so they have potential to achieve *good*.

The app is divided into four pillars, which reflect the complexity of natural river systems. The first 3 pillars: Water Quality, Physical Habitat, Flow make up the Ecological Trinity of Stream Health (Rangeley-Wilson et al, 2021), the fourth pillar importantly displays ecology.
