## Foreword

The primary objective of these Catchment Evidence Packs is to consolidate a diverse range of data sources underpinning WFD. They are preliminary reading ahead of Wessex E&B catchment planning workshops. This comprehensive tool integrates data from WIMS, Ecosys, River Habitat Survey, and, where available, third-party contributions from Citizen Science and Water Company monitoring. The overarching goal is to offer practitioners easy access to a wealth of information, at different scales which is required for catchment management.

The app is divided into four pillars, which reflect the complexity of natural river systems. The first 3 pillars: Water Quality, Physical Habitat, Flow make up the Ecological Trinity of Stream Health (Rangeley-Wilson et al, 2021), the fourth pillar crucially displays ecology.

The existing spatiotemporal coverage of monitoring, pivotal for informing Water Framework Directive (WFD) statuses of waterbodies, is now notably constrained. Unfortunately, this limitation is not transparently reflected in WFD statuses, leading our practitioners to make decisions based on either sparse data or, in some cases, no data at all.

We want to enable practicioners to review our evidence with ease, identify *reasons* waterbodies *are not achieving good* status (RNAGs) and then and put in place measures to restore waterbodies so they have potential to achieve *good*.
